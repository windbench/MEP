	abstract = {Measurements taken before and after the commissioning of three wind farms reveal that the wind speeds just upstream of each wind farm decrease relative to locations farther away after the turbines are turned on. At a distance of two rotor diameters upstream, the average derived relative slowdown is 3.4\%; at seven to ten rotor diameters upstream, the average slowdown is 1.9\%. Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) simulations point to wind-farm-scale blockage as the primary cause of these slowdowns. Blockage effects also cause front row turbines to produce less energy than they each would operating in isolation. Wind energy prediction procedures in use today ignore this effect, resulting in an overprediction bias that pervades the entire wind farm.},

It describes the sensitivity analysis and evaluation procedures that formed the basis for choosing the final setup of the mesoscale model simulations of the wind atlas. An optimal combination of model setup and parameterisations was found for simulating the climatology of the wind field at turbine-relevant heights with the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model. Initial WRF model sensitivity experiments compared the wind climate generated by using two commonly used planetary boundary layer schemes and were carried out over several regions in Europe. They confirmed that the largest differences in annual mean wind speed at 100\&thinsp;m above ground level mostly coincide with areas of high surface roughness length and not with the location of the domains or maximum wind speed. Then an ensemble of more than 50 simulations with different setups for a single year was carried out for one domain covering Northern Europe, for which tall mast observations were available. Many different parameters were varied across the simulations, for example, model version, forcing data, various physical parameterisations and the size of the model domain. These simulations showed that although virtually every parameter change affects the results in some way, significant changes on the wind climate in the boundary layer are mostly due to using different physical parameterisations, especially the planetary boundary layer scheme, the representation of the land surface, and the prescribed surface roughness length. Also, the setup of the simulations, such as the integration length and the domain size can considerably influence the results. The degree of similarity between winds simulated by the WRF ensemble members and the observations was assessed using a suite of metrics, including the Earth Mover's Distance (EMD), a statistic that measures the distance between two probability distributions. The EMD was used to diagnose the performance of each ensemble member using the full wind speed distribution, which is important for wind resource assessment. The most realistic ensemble members were identified to determine the most suitable configuration to be used in the final production run, which is fully described and evaluated in the second part of this study.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

In Part 1, we described the sensitivity experiments and accompanying evaluation done to arrive at the final mesoscale model setup used to produce the mesoscale wind atlas. In this paper, Part 2, we document how we made the final wind atlas product, covering both the production of the mesoscale climatology generated with the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model and the microscale climatology generated with the Wind Atlas Analysis and Applications Program (WAsP). The paper includes a detailed description of the technical and practical aspects that went into running the mesoscale simulations and the downscaling using WAsP. We show the main results from the final wind atlas and present a comprehensive evaluation of each component of the NEWA model chain using observations from a large set of tall masts located all over Europe. The added value of the WRF and WAsP downscaling of wind climatologies is evaluated relative to the performance of the driving ERA5 reanalysis and shows that the WRF downscaling reduces the mean wind speed bias and spread relative to that of ERA5 from {\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}{\textless}math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" id="M1" display="inline" overflow="scroll" dspmath="mathml"{\textgreater}{\textless}mrow{\textgreater}{\textless}mo{\textgreater}-{\textless}/mo{\textgreater}{\textless}mn mathvariant="normal"{\textgreater}1.50{\textless}/mn{\textgreater}{\textless}mo{\textgreater}±{\textless}/mo{\textgreater}{\textless}mn mathvariant="normal"{\textgreater}1.30{\textless}/mn{\textgreater}{\textless}/mrow{\textgreater}{\textless}/math{\textgreater}{\textless}span{\textgreater}{\textless}svg:svg xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="64pt" height="10pt" class="svg-formula" dspmath="mathimg" md5hash="6c1f8c39632c8c039ae61d1070d357dd"{\textgreater}{\textless}svg:image xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="gmd-13-5079-2020-ie00001.svg" width="64pt" height="10pt" src="gmd-13-5079-2020-ie00001.png"/{\textgreater}{\textless}/svg:svg{\textgreater}{\textless}/span{\textgreater}{\textless}/span{\textgreater} to {\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}0.02±0.78{\textless}/span{\textgreater}\&thinsp;m\&thinsp;s{\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}$^{\textrm{−1}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater}.
